## About The Project

I wanted a super simple framework for making games and visualizations in pure java with no dependancies. The point of a lot of bigger game engines and frameworks is to take care of "the boring stuff" for you so you can make your game quickly, but i quite enjoy "the boring stuff" so i wanted a framework that only takes care of rendering, keyboard input and audio for you.
